# JobListing-Platform
I built a job listing platform using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. Spring Boot ensured a scalable, production-ready backend, while MongoDB provided flexible data handling for job listings and applications. I used Swagger API for testing and documentation, ensuring well-structured, secure, and maintainable RESTful services.
